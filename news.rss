      <description>After months of deliberations, head-scratching, and careful planning, the move of all the RouterLabPrep.com content has been completed.  Thanks in no small part to the lapsing of the domain, we were able to cut through our own red tape and finally move the remaining published and draft articles.</description>

      <description>Over time, I will be moving posts from RouterLabPrep.com to this site.  Once the content move is complete, RouterLabPrep.com will eventually be decommissioned and redirect to the Articles section of this site until such time as I figure out what to do with it.</description>

      <description>It finally re-happened.  In replacing RouterLabPrep.com, this site will still let me share what I know already, what I&apos;m learning, and things coming along the horizon that may become technically significant in the IT world.  But everything posted is in proper context of what I do (running Primacore™), what Primacore™ stands for, and what I&apos;ve can offer the world to help solve IT problems.</description>
